      "description": "Waves whisper softly against a shore of polished black pebbles, glittering under the gentle glow of the moon. The air is heavy with salt, and the silhouette of a rusted lighthouse towers above, its metal exterior scarred by age and weather. Faint, rhythmic ticking echoes softly from within the structure, like the heartbeat of a slumbering giant.\n\nTo the north, a worn path leads up toward an archway at the lighthouse base, while eastward lies a shimmering tidepool catching moonbeams.",

      "description": "A stone archway, coated in clinging barnacles and strands of dried seaweed, stands firmly guarding the lighthouse entrance. An iron grate, etched intricately with gears and mechanical patterns, blocks your path forward. Through gaps in the grate, you glimpse shadows of silent machinery.\n\nA brass keyhole, tarnished but recently polished by use or care, glints in the silvery moonlight. The air here hums softly, resonating with the muffled clink of hidden gears waiting patiently for motion.",

Soft blue light pulses gently beneath the surface, creating mesmerizing patterns on the surrounding rocks. Among tangles of kelp and shells lies an old, tarnished glass lantern, partially submerged yet strangely undamaged.\n\nNearby, a narrow crevice descends into a hidden cave below, visible only due to the reflected gleam of watery luminescence.",
